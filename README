Autotrash is a small python script to automatically remove (permenantly delete) old FreeDesktop.org Trash files.

It scans the ~/local/share/Trash/info directory and reads the .trashinfo files. Files older then X days will be removed.

It should be considered to be run as a crontab:

@daily  $HOME/bin/autotrash.py
