Autotrash is a small python script to automatically removes
(permenantly delete) old FreeDesktop.org Trash files.

It scans the ~/.local/share/Trash/info directory and reads the .trashinfo
files to determine their deletion date. Files older then 30 days are
then removed including their trash information file.

You can configure the number of days using commandline parameters, use
the command "./autotrash.py --help" for more information.

        INSTALLATION
It should be considered to be run as a crontab:

@daily  $HOME/bin/autotrash.py

If you do not know how to work with crontab, you can add it to the startup 
programs in GNOME using the menu: System -> Preferences -> Sessions

Add the program with the "+ Add" button.
