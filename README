Autotrash is a small python script to automatically remove
(permenantly delete) old trashed files. It relies on the
FreeDesktop.org Trash files for it's deletion information.

It scans the ~/.local/share/Trash/info directory and reads the .trashinfo
files to determine their deletion date. Files older then 30 days are
then removed including their trash information file.

        INSTALLATION
It should be considered to be run as a crontab:

@daily  /usr/bin/autotrash

Or more frequently, but to keep disk IO down, only when there is less then 3GB of free space:

@hourly /usr/bin/autotrash --max-free 3072

To configure this, run "crontab -e" and add one of these lines in the editor, then save
and close the file.

If you do not know how to work with crontab, you could add it to the startup 
programs in GNOME using the menu: System -> Preferences -> Sessions

Add the program with the "+ Add" button.

This will make sure that your trash is cleaned up every time you log in.
