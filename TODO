- Add an option to have it register itself with crontab (an install yourself option).
- Move code to a separate python file and use a shellscript to wrap it
  so the code can be distributed in bytecode.
- Trash based on priority: documents are more important then movies, 
  so trash movies first.
- Write UnitTest to check conformance with the specifications
  here: http://www.ramendik.ru/docs/trashspec.html

Long term / per request:
- GTK+ interface with trash frequency graphs?
- Move to python XDG as soon as it supports Trash information files
- Add an interactive mode? Someone will have to request this per mail if this is really needed or even wanted.
