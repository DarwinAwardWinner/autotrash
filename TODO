- Write UnitTest to check conformance with the specifications
  here: http://www.ramendik.ru/docs/trashspec.html

Long term / per request:
- GTK+ interface with trash frequency graphs?
- Move to python XDG as soon as it supports Trash information files
- Add an option to have it register itself with crontab (an install yourself option).
