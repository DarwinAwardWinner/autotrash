- Add an option to have it register itself with crontab (an install yourself option).
- Move code to a separate python file and use a shellscript to wrap it so the code
  can be distributed in bytecode.

Long term / per request:
- Move to python XDG as soon as it supports Trash information files
- Add an interactive mode? Someone will have to request this per mail if this is really needed or even wanted.
